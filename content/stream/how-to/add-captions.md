# Add captions

Creating or modifying captions for a video requires a Cloudflare API Token..

The `$LANGUAGE` must adhere to the [BCP 47 format](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers). For your convenience, the most common language codes are provided below under [Common language codes](#common-language-codes). If the language you are adding is not included in the table, you can find the value through the [The IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry), which maintains a list of language codes you can search through. 

Below is an example value from IANA for Turkish.

```bash
%%
Type: language
Subtag: tr
Description: Turkish
Added: 2005-10-16
Suppress-Script: Latn
%%
```

The `Subtag` code indicates a value of `tr`, which is the value you should send as the `language` at the end of the PUT request shown below.

A label is generated from the provided language, and the label will be visible for user selection in the player. For example, if `tr` is sent, the `Türkçe` label is created. If `de` is sent, the `Deutsch` label is created.

## Limitations

- A video must be uploaded before a caption can be attached to it. The video's ID is referenced as `media_id`.
- Stream only supports [WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) formatted caption files. If you have a differently formatted caption file, please use [a tool to convert your file to WebVTT](https://subtitletools.com/convert-to-vtt-online) prior to uploading it.
- Videos may include several language captions, but each language must be unique. For example, a video may have English, French, and German captions associated with it, but it cannot have two French captions.
- Each caption file is limited to 10 MB in size. [Contact support](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/articles/200172476) if you need to upload a larger file.
