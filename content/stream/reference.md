## Stream Live Billing 

Stream Live billing works the same way as Stream On-demand:

* You pay $5 per 1000 minutes of recorded video.
* You pay $1 per 1000 minutes of delivered video.

All Stream Live videos are automatically recorded, and there is no additional cost for encoding and packaging live videos.
